# Release Notes

## 2026-07-28

- RazorVue now consumes the final Roslyn compilation produced by the Razor Source Generator. It no longer requires Razor host outputs or reparsing generated C#.
- Jazor output is configured through `JazorMode`: `none` produces no files, `debug` produces modules and a manifest, and `release` produces the production bundle.
- The default output root is `wwwroot/jazor`; release builds write only `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` to that directory.
- Public Vue binding packages are compatible with .NET 11 Preview 6.

## 2026-07-27

- RazorVue render-context now covers the core generated component semantics for render surface, component props, DOM and component events, slots, bind, lifecycle, references, metadata, and browser DOM behavior.
- RazorVue now has a direct VNode emitter for linear element/content/attribute output, static component props/listeners, regions, static markup, non-generic and typed scoped slots, bulk attrs, element key/value updates, DOM bind modifiers, named event metadata, and ref captures, with render-context retained as oracle/transition coverage.
- Production bundling now supports explicit Deno and Netpack lanes over the same manifest contract.
- Import-backed `.vue` SFC assets now flow from explicit component references into the manifest and production bundles without source-root scanning or a separate frontend asset API.
- External package consumers can build RazorVue output and Netpack bundles from the local `Jazor` NuGet package path without relying on repository-local tool binaries.
- RazorVue now has a G2 performance benchmark entrypoint that records runtime throughput, browser heap, generated artifact size, build timing, and release performance reports.
